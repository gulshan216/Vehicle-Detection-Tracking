**Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

#### 1. Extracting HOG features from the training images.

The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook (or in lines # through # of the file called `some_file.py`).  

I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `LUV` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=6`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:

#### 2. Final choice of HOG parameters.

I tried various combinations of parameters and got the best accuracy with the following combination of parameters:
Color_space = YCrCb, orientations=9, pixels_per_cell=(8, 8), cells_per_block=(2, 2), hog_channel = 'ALL'   Accuracy = 0.945

#### 3. Training a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

I trained a linear SVM using spatial binning, color histogram and HOG based features. The classifier gives an accuracy of 98.8% on the test set.

### Sliding Window Search

#### 1. Implementing a sliding window search.

I decided to implement the HOG subsampling based sliding window technique, wherein instead of performing feature extraction on each window individually which can be time consuming, the HOG features are extracted for the entire image (or a selected portion of it) and then these full-image features are subsampled according to the size of the window and then fed to the classifier.

#### 2. Examples of test images to demonstrate how the pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

#### 1. Link to the final video output. 
Here's a [link to my video result](./test_videos_output/output_video.mp4)


#### 2. Filtering for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:
